Purpose & definition
====================

Note that all files at this level should be considered as test for the real
project, which is in the subdirectory libmqueue. I.e. when deployed, either
link files from there, link the directory, or build the directory and
install as library.

This project implements POSIX 1003.1B rt-queues for systems that don't
already have it. Implementation is ultra light as it was originally
intended for deeply embedded systems. Alternative use is therefore
substitution a already existing implementation for memory foot-print or
speed reasons.

It uses no other API's than what's available in all libc's (even the
most minimalistic ones) and semaphores. I.e. it can be used almost
anywhere as either a drop-in replacement or as en extension.
